# 🌍 GreenRoute: A Dynamic Route Optimization and Emission Reduction System

The **GreenRoute** system is an innovative solution designed to optimize logistics operations by leveraging real-time data. By integrating traffic, weather, and vehicle data, GreenRoute provides logistics managers and drivers with optimized routes that minimize delays and reduce carbon emissions. 🚚🌱

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Optimization**: Utilizes live traffic and weather data for up-to-date routing.
- **Carbon Footprint Reduction**: Reduces emissions by selecting the most eco-friendly routes.
- **Seamless Integration**: Connects to external APIs for real-time data retrieval.
- **Actionable Insights**: Offers clear and data-driven recommendations for logistics managers and drivers.

## 🛠️ Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later 🐍
- Pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for cloning the repository) 🌟

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/greenroute.git
cd greenroute
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```



### Step 3: Set Up API Keys
GreenRoute relies on external APIs for traffic and weather data. To configure these:

1. Sign up for the respective API services (e.g., Google Maps API, OpenWeatherMap API). 🌐
2. Add your API keys to a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```plaintext
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Application
Start the system by running the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🔧 Key Dependencies

- `requests`: For API calls 🌐
- `geopy`: For geocoding and distance calculations 🗺️
- `dotenv`: For managing environment variables 📦
- `flask` (optional): If you plan to create a web interface 🌐



## 📚 How It Works

1. **Data Integration**: Gathers live traffic, weather, and vehicle data.
2. **Route Optimization**: Processes data using advanced algorithms to find the most efficient routes.
3. **Insights Delivery**: Presents route suggestions to drivers and managers via a user-friendly interface or a backend system.

## 🎯 Goals

- Reduce fuel consumption and emissions 🌿
- Improve delivery times ⏱️
- Enhance operational efficiency 📈
